This  directory  contains  drivers  for testing  a  few  routines  for
computing eigenvalues  of general sparse (symmetric  real) matrix pair
(A, B), where B has to  be positive definite.  

The drivers are split into three groups, Lan_MM, KPM_MM, Lan_.
Lan_MM reads the matrices from matrix market files (matfile), and uses
  Lanczos to compute the density of states.

KPM_MM reads the matrices from matrix market files (matfile), and uses
  KPM to compute the density of states.

Lap_ Uses laplician routines for matrices, and uses
  KPM to compute the density of states.

The second part of the name indicates the following:

R:Rational filtering
P:Polynomial filtering

Lan: Lanczos

R: Restarting
N: Non-Restarting


matfile : input file containing the path to the matrix to be read by Gen*.c

          MatrixFormat: coordinate format (matrix market format)
            MM0: matrix format indexing starts at 0 
            MM1: matrix format indexing starts at 1
          a, b : interval [a, b] of interest
          nslices: number of slices for spectrum slicing
