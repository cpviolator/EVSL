 DRIVERS FOR STANDARD PROBLEMS
----------------------------------------

Lap*
 
 Drivers for testing a few  methods on simple Laplacean matrices.  You
 will also find here a driver for a matrix-free test whereby no matrix
 is passed  but the  matrix vector-product is  done via  function (and
 set-up as a function pointer).

MM*
 
 Drivers for testing a few  routines to compute eigenvalues of general
 sparse (symmetric real) matrices. These matrices are read from a file
 in  the matrix  market  format. Note:  The HB  matrix  format is  not
 supported.

----------------------------------------
 DRIVERS FOR GENERALIZED PROBLEMS
---------------------------------------- 

Gen/

  Test drivers  are for  testing  a  few routines for computing
  eigenvalues of general sparse (symmetric real) matrix pair (A, B),
  where B has to be positive definite. 
  
----------------------------------------
 DOS METHODS
----------------------------------------

Two methods for computing the density of states are used

KPM
  
  Uses the Kernel Polynomial Method to compute the DOS

Lan(dos)
  
  Uses Lanczo's to compute the DOS

----------------------------------------
Filtering
----------------------------------------
Two types of filtering are available

Rational
  
  Uses rational filtering. Built in includes embedded CXsparse. For
  better performance install SuiteSpasre and change the makefile.in
  accordingly

Polynomial
  
  Uses Chebyshev Polynomial filtering.


----------------------------------------
 OTHER 
---------------------------------------- 

Landos
 
 Drivers for  testing Density of  states routines. So far  the Lanczos
 method for DOS is tested.
